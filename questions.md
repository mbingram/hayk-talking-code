## What's the difference between a class and an instance of a class? (Mary Beth Ingram)
A "Class" is a blueprint, or template, which you then use to make objects that will have parameters specified by the class, and will be able to access the class's variables.
An "Instance" of a class is an object that you made using that specific class. The word "instance" indicates a relationship of an object to its class.
Additionally, class variables are shared between a class and all its subclasses, while class instance variables only belong to one specific class.

## Describe the HTTP Request/Response cycle (Mary Beth Ingram)
The request-response cycle begins with a client (clients can be browsers or computers that are also acting as servers for other requests) sending a request message to a server. The server handles the request and sends a response message back to the client. The request, as well as the response, will be in the form of an HTTP message. An HTTP message has a header and sometimes a body. The header contains meta-information about the message, and the body contains the content. If a response is not given within an expected timeframe (the "timeout"), it is considered failed.
